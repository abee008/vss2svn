<h4>Description</h4>
<p><strong>vss2svn</strong> is a Perl script to migrate revision history from a Microsoft Visual SourceSafe (VSS) database to the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> version control system. It will migrate all revision history, including comments, author names, and optionally revision dates (migrating dates uses a not-officially-supported feature of Subversion and can only be done if you are migrating to a brand-new Subversion repository).</p>

<p>This project has nothing to do with the <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1158.shtml">vss2svn.py</a> Python script which is floating around. Its methodology is loosely based on the <a href="http://www.riseup.com/~brettw/dev/VSS2Subversion.html">migrate.pl</a> script I found after some googling; however, I was not able to get that script to work properly and decided to start from scratch rather than try to modify it.</p>
