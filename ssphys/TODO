   {{{ 
      find data\ -name \?\?\?\?aaaa | xargs -n 1 ssphys get -b --force-overwrite -v 1 --output stage\   
   }}}
 * set date/time to timestamp of action
 * make read only
 * wildcard get with --output-dir command? 
 * solve the command specific option "-v" and global option "--version" problem
 * check wether there is some checksum to verify, wether get operation was succesfull
 * in output directory mode, check wether the output file is identically to the input file
 * implement the saving of reconstructed project status files
 + write output file with same name as input file into another directory
 
++++ validate command ++++
 * check consecutivness of timestamps
 * validate checksums
 * linkage of records
