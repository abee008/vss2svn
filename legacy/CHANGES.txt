0.3.1
    * Fixed issue with compiled .exe not printing help info correctly
    * Updated INSTALL file to reflect Time::ParseDate requirement
    * Updated README file

  Known Issues:
    * Still doesn't handle label comments correctly
    * Doesn't handle VSS cloaked projects correctly

0.3.0
    * Generally much more user friendly, with useful prompts, error msgs, etc.
    * Automatically detect user's regionalized date and time formats from
      Windows registry
    * Explicitly checks for ss.exe and svn.exe on path before starting
    * No longer dies on VSS "pinned" files
    * Attempt to correct for user's timezone
    * Remove redundant internal "filetype" check when building file histories
    * Add --exclude switch to allow excluding arbitrary subprojects
      from migration
    * Revived --debug switch; this sends *all* output to the screen! (Still
      goes to logfile as well)
    * Add --timebias switch to override timezone detection
    * Changed --login argument to --vsslogin
    * The following new Perl modules are now required (all are base
      to ActiveState build)
        - Win32::TieRegistry
        - Pod::Usage
        - Text::Wrap

  Known Issues:
    * Still doesn't handle label comments correctly

0.2.2
    * Use tempfiles for more ss.exe commands instead of piping
      directly to STDOUT; this prevents ss.exe from undesirably
      line-breaking and paginating output. (bugzilla issue #1)

    * Change license from "public domain" to Gnu GPL.
0.2.1
    * fix reading version numbers greater than 9.
    * handle "--vssproject $/" correctly
    * remove "use diagnostics", which only confuses regular users
    * print startup message so doesn't appear to hang on large projects
    * passing an invalid project is a fatal error
    * prevent SQL quotes from appearing in users prompt

0.2.0
    * Use the DBD::SQLite driver instead of temporary text files;
      performance greatly improved on large VSS databases

0.1.0
    * Initial import of script.
