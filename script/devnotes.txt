DEVELOPMENT NOTES - VSS2SVN 0.10+

These are the development notes for the "new, improved" vss2svn script. Previous versions (0.1 - 0.3) were based on parsing output from Microsoft's ss.exe tool. The script was rewritten to instead use the ssphys.exe command-line tool, which is the result of a reverse-engineering effort on the VSS backend database files.

SQLITE SCHEMA

All information about the conversion is stored in a SQLite version 2 database, using the DBD::SQLite Perl module. This is a wholly self-contained DBMS which offers SQL syntax, transactions, and a single database file. It is available in ActiveState's PPM repository, which means it is pre-compiled for Windows users.

Following is a description of the SQLite schema used by this project:

    'Physical' table : contains information about physical VSS files
        physname (VARCHAR)  : name of physical VSS file
        status (INTEGER)    : 0 = history not yet retrieved
                              1 = history has been retrieved from this file
    
    'Action' table : contains information about individual actions performed
                     in VSS history
        action_id (INTEGER) : primary key for Action table
        physname (VARCHAR)  : name of physical VSS file
        type (VARCHAR)      : type of action (ADD, RENAME, LABEL, etc.)
        itemname (VARCHAR)  : name of item being acted upon
        itemtype (INTEGER)  : 1 = project
                              2 = file
        timestamp (VARCHAR) : timestamp in yyyymmdd.hhmmss.x format
                              (.x is literal to prevent treating as numeric)
        author (VARCHAR)    : name of user who performed action
        info (VARCHAR)      : action-specific info (such as previous name on
                              renames)
        comment (TEXT)      : user-supplied comment for this action
    
    'Revision' table: contains information about eventual atomic SVN revisions
        revision_id (INT.)  : primare key for Revision table
        svndate (VARCHAR)   : svn:date formatted timestamp
        author (VARCHAR)    : name of author for this atomic revision
        comment (TEXT)      : comment for this atomic revision
        status              : 0 = revision has been imported to SVN
                              1 = revision not yet imported

    'RevisionAction' table: many-to-many link between Revision and Action
        revision_id (INT.)  : primary key for Revision table
        action_id (INTEGER) : primary key for Action table
